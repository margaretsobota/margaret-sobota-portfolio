              I am a senior at Northwestern University studying
              computer science. My specialization in computer science is
              web development â€“ both mobile and web-based. Though I mainly
              focuses on frontend web development, I spent six months through
              the summer and fall of 2020 working as a full-stack Software
              Engineer Intern at a startup called OXO in San Francisco. At this
              company, I worked end-to-end on many crucial projects for the
              company's cross-platform mobile app, including a project to
              obtain a stream of vehicle data from hardware devices to display
              in real time in the frontend application. I will further my
              web development skills as a Software Engineer Intern at LinkedIn
              in the summer of 2021. In my spare time, I enjoy painting
              portraits and hiking.
